I'm a Software Engineer, currently working at Uber on Android stuff. I work on Uber's Navigation 
SDK that powers Uber's drivers and their trips. I'm also active in the open source community and I am one of the maintainers of 
[AutoDispose](https://github.com/uber/AutoDispose) (fun fact: I worked on AutoDispose before joining Uber too). For more of my projects 
you can find me at [GitHub](https://github.com/shaishavgandhi05).

Outside of work, I love to ride my bike. I'm a bedroom musician and I spend a bunch of my time
playing guitar and singing. I'm also an obsessive Beatles fan and a big fan of classic rock in general 
(Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Dylan etc.)

I love to read and you can find me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32521118-shaishav-gandhi) to check out what I'm currently reading.
